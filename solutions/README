This zip includes my code for challenges from 1 to 13 and 16.

Comments:

* Challenge 2: I did not submit correctly the source file, here it is

* Challenge 4: there are 3 files:

    - challenge04-pre1.py: takes the 8 gb integers file to make a shorter list
     of integers without the interval with consecutive numbers
     
    - challenge04-pre2.py: takes the shorter list of numbers and gets the
     missing ones to make an array
     
    - challenge04.py: with this array of 100 numbers, returns the correct
     the missing number according to the position
 
* Challenge 12: I didn't submit it (actually I didn't pass the test). Though I
 think I got really close to it.

* Challenge 16: I din't submit it but I did pass the test (I din't have time to
 submit it)
